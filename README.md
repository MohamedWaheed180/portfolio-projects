# Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my portfolio repository.  
This repo collects a set of projects I have developed in the fields of **AI, Analytics, and Automation**.  
Each project is organized in its own folder with a dedicated README file that provides detailed documentation, diagrams, and case studies.
---
## 📌 How to Navigate
- Each project folder contains:
  - `README.md` with detailed description, objectives, architecture, and results.
  - Diagrams or screenshots (when available).
  - References to case studies or external documentation.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as a **portfolio showcase**.  
It highlights my ability to design scalable, AI-powered solutions, build analytics dashboards, and automate enterprise workflows.  
While some projects are based on confidential company work, the documentation here focuses on **concepts, architecture, and outcomes** rather than proprietary code.
